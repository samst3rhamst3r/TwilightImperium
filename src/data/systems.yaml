# This .yaml is formatted as follows:
# 
# The key of each entry is the numerical value as printed on the tile. It was chosen to use the number itself, instead of,
#   for example, a list of entries, where each system number == index + 1, as it decouples the indexing to have exact match
#   data directly from the tile. The index number can then be used directly by other parts of the application
#
# Every entry MAY have zero or more of the following items:
#
#   planets: A list [] of planets in this system, whose names will be used as keys within the planets.yaml file
#   wormhole: a string representing one of three types of wormholes - "alpha", "beta", and "delta"
#   anomaly: a string representing one of four types of anomalies - "asteroid_field", "nebula", "supernova", "gravity_rift"
#
# Some tiles/systems are completely blank, and so they have no entries in their dictionary - they are simply set to NULL
#
