# This .yaml is formatted as follows:
# 
# The key of each entry is the numerical value as printed on the tile. It was chosen to use the number itself, instead of,
#   for example, a list of entries, where each system number == index + 1, as it decouples the indexing to have exact match
#   data directly from the tile. The index number can then be used directly by other parts of the application
# 
# Every entry WILL have:
#   back_color: a str Enum type signifying what color the back of the tile is - a home system (GREEN),
#     a regular system (BLUE), or an anomaly/empty system (RED). Used for initial map setup.
# 
# Every entry MAY have zero or more of the following items:
#
#   planets: a list [] of planets in this system, whose names will be used as keys within the planets.yaml file
#   wormhole: a str Enum type representing one of three types of wormholes - ALPHA, BETA, or DELTA
#   anomaly: a str Enum type representing one of four types of anomalies - ASTEROID_FIELD, GRAVITY_RIFT, NEBULA, or SUPERNOVA
