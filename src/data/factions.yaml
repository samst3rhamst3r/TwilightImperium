# Each race has its unique name as the unique key identifier in this dictionary.
# Every race will be formatted in the following way:
# 
# [RACE NAME]:
#   home_systems: [ Numerical value used as a key in systems.yaml
#   commodities:  Numerical value which is the max commodities this race can hold
#   abilities:    List [] of this race's unique special abilities (used as keys in abilities.yaml)]
#   start_techs:  List [] of technologies this race starts the game with (used as keys in techs.yaml)
#   units: 
#     
#     Within the application, default "name"s and "start"ing amounts will be applied for each races' units. 
#     This .yaml will only contain names of race-unique units, and starting amounts > 0, in order to consolidate the file size
#     
#     Each unit type follows the following convention:
#     [type_of_unit]:
#       name: Unique name of this unit, used as a key in units.yaml
#       start: Starting amount of this type of unit if start amount > 0
#     
#     Possible units contained in this field include the following, with associated default names -
#     
#     flagship:     Required by every race, cannot be defaulted
#     war_sun:      Defaults to NULL, as most races do not start the game with War Sun capabilities
#     dreadnought:  Defaults to "Dreadnought I"
#     carrier:      Defaults to "Carrier I"
#     cruiser:      Defaults to "Cruiser I"
#     destroyer:    Defaults to "Destroyer I"
#     fighter:      Defaults to "Fighter I"
#     infantry:     Defaults to "Infantry I"
#     space_dock:   Defaults to "Space Dock I"
#     pds:          Defaults to "PDS I"
